# ProcrastiMate

> Professional-grade procrastination, engineered.

ProcrastiMate is a satirical CLI tool that helps you **delay tasks responsibly** by:
- detecting vague tasks
- generating realistic corporate excuses
- rescheduling work in a believable way

This is **not** a productivity tool.  
It is a *plausibility engine*.
